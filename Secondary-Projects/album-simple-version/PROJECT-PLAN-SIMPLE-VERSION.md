**_ Project planning_**

> Simple version/ First version

## 1) User functionality

1️⃣ -- As an user, I want the background of the page to change to an custom image of my choice 💹
2️⃣ -- As an user, I want to review an album at a click of an button 💹
3️⃣ -- As an user, I want the output to be in the console (For now) 💹
4️⃣ -- As an user, I want the output to be showed one by one, not all at once 💹
5️⃣ -- As an user, I want at the end to be shown if the album is bellow mid album, a mid album or an above mid album together with the final score 💹

## 2) Features

1️⃣ -- Create an async function that changes the background of the page to the inputed image as soon as the review starts 💹
2️⃣ -- Create a function that takes all the data from the album given by the user and calculate all the calculations needed when the button is pressed 💹
3️⃣ -- All the needed outputs need to be in the console 💹
4️⃣ -- Create a (setTimeout/setInterval) function that logs all the outputs into the console within the setted interval 💹
5️⃣ -- Create a function where the final score is compared to a number to decide if the album is mid or not 💹

## 3) Flow of the code

Start review button --> The background changes to the selected picture --> Log the songs with the given notes --> Calculate the average scores --> Wait 5 seconds between iterations using the wait function --> Log the final result

## 4) Arhitecture

-- Mainly functions and import/export uses
